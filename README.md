# Wizard Harry

Wizard Harry was a solo project for the Turing School of Software & Design, which was completed in just six days. I chose to implement the Harry Potter API (https://potterapi.com/), as well as the Advice Slip API (https://api.adviceslip.com/) to add some humor into the project! Enjoy!
